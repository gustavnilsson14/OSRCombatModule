                <p>Combat happens when people disagree violently, and is resolved in the following way, usually involving bruises, blood, and death.</p>

                <p>The following are core concepts of the combat system.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combat takes place on a 1d battle mat called the <i>Battleground</i>. You either push forward, or fall back.</li>
                    <li>Combat has two measures of time. <i>Rounds</i>, which consists of an arbitrary amount of <i>Turns</i></li>
                    <li>Combatants can only specify their actions at the beginning of each <i>Round</i>, while during this time, their actions each <i>Turn</i> is dictated by their planning</li>
                    <li>Combat ends when at the end of a <i>Round</i> either one side is defeated, or has fled the battleground</li>
                    <li>Exploiting an enemys <i>weaknesses</i> is important to fighting effectively</li>
                    <li>Likewise, using terrain, features, and hazards of the battlegrounds is equally important</li>
                    <li>Combatants are likely to be permanently damaged, die, or be kidnapped in the aftermath of combat, players, and their opponents alike</li>
                </ul>

            <box class="x2">
                <h2>The Battleground</h2>
                <p>The Battleground consists of 11 tiles, where two sides can duke it out. Each tile will have a width and a type of terrain, as well as possibly a feature, and a hazard</p>
                <p>When the battle starts the GM first decides on the position of the two opposing parties, depending on the scene.</p>
                <img src="img/battleground.jpg" alt="">
            </box>
            <box>
                <h3>Movement</h3>
                <p>Combatants may move 1 tile at the start of every round if taking the <i>dash</i> tactical action, then 1 tile at the start of each turn.</p>
                <p>These rules apply to movement</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conscious combatants of opposing sides may not occupy the same tile.</li>
                    <li>Combatants of the same side may occupy the same tile, and move freely through tiles occupied by their allies.</li>
                    <li>A combatant cannot move past an opponent.</li>
                    <li>Opposing combatants moving into the same tile roll 1d12, adding their strength to the result. The lower result will be unable to move</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Depending on the combatants perks and/or equipment, they may be able to move further, or ignore some rules regarding invalid movement. These rules are also designed for mainly grounded combat. Aerial combat, or underwater combat would have different rules for movement.</p>
            </box>
            <box>
                <h3>Terrain</h3>
                <p>The terrain of a tile may increase or decrease damage of incoming ranged attacks, as well as increase the amount of movement required to cross it.</p>
                <p>When a tile has a terrain which requires 2 or more movements to cross, resolve it as it was two tiles, and keep track of the combatants progress.</p>
                <h4>Tile width</h4>
                <p>A tile can only contain an amount of characters less than or equal to its width.</p>
                <img src="img/terrain-7-1-1-758x635.jpg" alt="">                
            </box>
            <box>
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>A tile feature can be anything from a watchtower, to abandoned house, or maybe a ballista. Features are used by combatants to fortify, or push hard from certain positions on the battleground, to setting devious traps.</p>
                <h4>Interaction</h4>
                <p>Each feature has its own usage, but they may only be interacted with before the start of a new <i>Round</i>.</p>
                <p>All features have a requirement of how to interact with them, from an amount of combatants to be present, to a certain damage type to hit them.</p>
                <h4>Scouting</h4>
                <p>Some features are face down as combat starts, and will only be discovered when scouted. A hidden feature is scouted when a combatant stands on the same tile as it.</p>
                <p>A combatant can spend turns to increase their scouting radius while stationary, moving will reset their extended scouting radius. For each turn scouting, the combatant will scout features one tile further away from them.</p>
            </box>
            <box>
                <h3>Hazards</h3>
                <p>A tile can be hazardous to combatants. It might be on fire, have puddles of corrosive acid, toxic gas, or deep chasms dangerously close to the battle.</p>
                <p>Each hazard is unique, might have a duration of rounds it is present, and will make any combatants starting a turn on the hazard suffer its negative effects.</p>
                <p>Some equipment, and incantations may create hazards on the battleground</p>

                <h3>Guide</h3>
                <p>The turn is resolved in the following manner</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each melee combatant chooses a target in range, prioritizing their planned target. If the planned target is out of range, they attack a random target.</li>
                    <li>All combatants move.</li>
                    <li>All melee combatants attack. Melee targets which have moved out of range causes the attack to miss.</li>
                    <li>All unprepared ranged attackers prepare an attack</li>
                    <li>Prepared ranged attackers attack</li>
                    <li>Force is calculated where there are opposing fronts.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Step by step, this is how combat works.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Battle is initiated, is any party ambushing the other?</li>
                    <li>Plan your actions during the round. What is your target tile, and what will you do?</li>
                    <li>Use equipment, and move</li>
                    <li>Determine the amount of turns in the round depending on the players party first, then the opponents desired turn amount.</li>
                    <li>If both parties decided for 0 turns, the combat ends, otherwise proceed to step 7.</li>
                    
                    <li>The first turn starts.</li>

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>As combat starts, all combatants of each respective side are placed on opposing sides, at tile #3. The GM may then, at their discretion move combatants forward, or backwards up to 2 tiles, depending on their perception of how the battle started.</p>

                <h4>First Strike</h4>
                <p>If a combatant was caught by surprise, with their weapons sheethed and guard down, the initiators may get a first strike. This allows any combatant who was combat ready as the combat starts to attack a non-combat ready combatant within range once.</p>

                <h4>Ambush</h4>
                <p>If either side ambushed the other side, seemingly springing up from nowhere, trapping or surrounding their opponents, the combat starts as an ambush.</p>
                <p>When placing combatants on the battleground when an ambush happens, place the ambushed side on tile #6, and the ambushers on a tile #1 of their choice.</p>
                <p>During the first <i>round</i> of an ambush, the ambushers choose how many <i>turns</i> it would last.</p>
            </box>

            <box>
                <h3>Rounds and Turns</h3>
                <p>A round of combat is an amount of turns decided by both the fighting parties. A turn of combat is enough time for every combatant involved to move, and perform an action.</p>
                
                <h4>Commitment</h4>
                <p>As a round of combat starts, the players must decide, and commit to how many turns they wish to fight, a number between 1-5. This is then offset by the enemy group's desired turn amount, and the average turn amount between the two is used, rounded in favor of the players.</p>

                <p>Tactical actions resolve immediately, and simultaneously.</p>

                <p>Endurance is a measure of how combat ready a character is. The more damage comes their way, the more endurance is spent to dodge or deflect that damage, until they are finally hit and suffer wounds.</p>
                <p>As endurance reaches 0, it can be reduced no further, and instead the character suffers wounds, with one exception.</p>
                <p>If any damage would result in a negative endurance less than or equal to a combatants negative max endurance, they die instantly.</p>

                <p>Each time a combatant is damaged when at 0 endurance they suffer a wound. The amount of wounds sustained have these effects.</p>

                <h3>Fronts</h3>
                <p>When opposing melee combatants meet on the battleground a front is created. How melee attackers are allowed to attack, and how the front moves, has specific rules.</p>

                <h4>Rules of attacking</h4>
                <p>Before any opposing combatant in a front can be the target of two attacks during the same turn, every enemy combatant must be the target of an attack. Only if your side of the front outnumber the other side, you can target the same target as one of your allies.</p>

                <h4>Force</h4>
                <p>For each <i>turn</i> during a <i>round</i>, each combatant in a front which deals more damage than they suffer will add 1 point of <i>force</i> to their front.</p>
                <p>At the end of the round, the side with most force may move forward, pushing the other side backwards.</p>

                <p>All things a character carries with them which are of note are represented by a item card. Item cards represent any weapons, protection, or tools the character carries and have at their disposal.

                <h3>Stats</h3>
                <p>All items have stats, but depending on the type of the item the stats may mean different things.</p>
                <h4>Quality</h4>
                <p>The round slots are called quality. The quality of an item counts as both a durability, and an effect icon. Filling in the quality slot as the result of damaging the item will also result in the quality being lost for effect purposes.</p>
                <h4>Durability</h4>
                <p>The durability of an item is a measure of how much damage the item can withstand. When all durability, and quality slots are filled in as a result of damage, an item is destroyed.</p>
                <h4>Effect</h4>
                <p>The effect of an item counts towards either the damage rating, or armor value of the item. Quality also adds to this</p>
            </box>
            <box>
                <h3>Item damage</h3>
                <p>When an item is either used for somthing it is not intended for, suffers rough physical treatment, is partially or completely consumed, or due to certain combat actions and events, it takes damage.</p>
                <p>When an item takes damage, cross out the first durability or quality slot (starting from the top left) which is not yet filled in.</p>
                <p>Some items, at the GM's discretion are not destroyed when all durability or quality slots are filled in, and may be recharged or refilled, although this is an exception</p>
                <h4>Repair</h4>
                <p>Repairing a weapon may restore sturdy quality slots. Repairing a quality slot will take some time, and resources, usually worth around ~75% of what the quality slot would cost if new.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Weapons add a damage die to each attack. Which die depends on their <i>damage rating</i></li>

                            <li>Weapons have several damage types. If a weapon hits an enemy and has a damage type that combatant is weak against, it deals <i>critical damage</i></li>
                            <li>All weapons can have one <i>condition</i> they may apply. These are not stated by the weapon cards, but added either randomly or at the discretion of the GM.</li>
                            <li>There are two types of weapons, <i>melee</i> and <i>ranged</i></li>
                            <li>Quality and effect increases the weapons <i>damage rating</i> by 1</li>

                        <h4>Adding conditions</h4>
                        <p>As the player characters aquire a new weapon, it will either be a prepared weapon which the GM has already decided on the condition it applies, or an unprepared weapon the GM did not account for.</p>
                        <p>For weapons not prepared in advance, the GM decides on a condition type, and the player aquiring the weapon rolls a die on that condition types table to determine which condition the weapon applies.</p>
                        <p>Note down which condition the weapon may apply on the weapon card.</p>

                                The people living in the cities of the old world are commonly known as scavengers, or scavs for short. They are quite<br> sceptical of outsiders of their <br>small tribes, but form tight <br>loyalties and friendships once <br>they accept new blood. Scrap, <br>doodads and trash is plenty<br> in the ruins, so resources<br> are plenty for crafting. <br>
                                Food, and drinking water is<br> more scarce as the soil is bad <br>for farming, and water usually <br>floods then flows off. <br> Stockpiled food also has a tendency <br>to attract roidrats, jellies, or raids from Saurian tribes.

                            <p>Where you find good soil, clean groundwater, and less contaminants, you  will find <br>that small authoritarian settlements <br>form naturally, which are commonly <br>called conclaves. These vary in <br>alignment when it comes to ethics,<br> but always strictly enforce their<br> laws. Many conclaves are indifferent <br>of outsiders, viewing them as lower <br>caste, and of less value than the<br> conclave citizens. While heavily <br>onset by raiders, conclaves are <br>usually equipped for the task, <br>with quality defenses prepared for <br>the inevitable invasions.</p>

To the outsider, the <br>swamp is often a deathtrap. Many<br> creatures here lay in ambush,<br> and a failure to read the signs<br> will cause a wanderer to be either <br>consumed by swamp kelp, captured by <br>the gators, eaten by ticks, crayfish, or leeches, or to just drown in a whirlpool.</p>

                            <p>Sentient remnants of the old world, super quality at their time, but after centuries without repairs are a dying kind. Androids are self replicating given the conditions to do so, but after the collapse this has not been so. Severed from the network, the local auxiliary AI’s took over the individual android bodies, as the decades <br> passed by they evolved<br> into individuals. <br>Usually, androids <br>are met with <br>courtesy, but <br>restraint. Many humans either push <br>them away, or try to exploit them. Few friendship bonds are formed with androids, even though it is certainly possible.</p>

If this is <br>a byproduct of their long lifespan,<br> or if they were made this way<br> anyone who could say is long <br>since dead.
